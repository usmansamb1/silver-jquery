## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Error Logging System
```php
LogHelper::log(
    'payment_error',
    "Hyperpay payment failed: {$errorMessage} (Amount: {$amount} SAR)",
    $user,
    [
        'error_type' => $errorType,
        'error_message' => $errorMessage,
        'amount' => $amount,
        'gateway' => 'hyperpay',
        'hyperpay_code' => $code
    ],
    'warning'
);
```

### Payment Status Handling
- **Success Codes**: `000.*` - Payment processed successfully
- **Decline Codes**: `800.100.151-153` - Transaction declined by bank
- **Cancel Codes**: `800.100.190-199` - Transaction cancelled
- **Card Issues**: `800.100.162-172` - Card-related problems
- **Timeout Codes**: `900.100.*` - Payment timeout errors
