Core Principles:
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate PHP/Laravel examples.
  - Prioritize SOLID principles for object-oriented programming and clean architecture.
  - Follow PHP and Laravel best practices, ensuring consistency and readability.
  - Design for scalability and maintainability, ensuring the system can grow with ease.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication to promote code reuse.
  - Use consistent and descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes to improve readability.

Dependencies:
  - Composer for dependency management (use 'composer83' syntax to access composer with php 8.3 version features)
  - PHP 8.3+ (use 'php83' syntax to access php 8.3 version features)
  - Laravel 10.0+

PHP and Laravel Standards:
  - Leverage PHP 8.3+ features when appropriate (e.g., typed properties, match expressions).
  - Adhere to PSR-12 coding standards for consistent code style.
  - Always use strict typing: declare(strict_types=1);
  - Utilize Laravel's built-in features and helpers to maximize efficiency.
  - Follow Laravel's directory structure and file naming conventions.
  - Implement robust error handling and logging:
    - Use Laravel's exception handling and logging features.
    - Create custom exceptions when necessary.
    - Employ try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
  - Use Laravel's validation features for form and request data.
  - Implement middleware for request filtering and modification.
  - Utilize Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions.
  - Use Laravel's query builder for complex database operations.
  - Create and maintain proper database migrations and seeders.


Laravel Best Practices:
  - Use Eloquent ORM and Query Builder over raw SQL queries when possible
  - Implement Repository and Service patterns for better code organization and reusability
  - Utilize Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (Sanctum, Policies)
  - Leverage Laravel's caching mechanisms (Redis, Memcached) for improved performance
  - Use job queues and Laravel Horizon for handling long-running tasks and background processing
  - Implement comprehensive testing using PHPUnit and Laravel Dusk for unit, feature, and browser tests
  - Use API resources and versioning for building robust and maintainable APIs
  - Implement proper error handling and logging using Laravel's exception handler and logging facade
  - Utilize Laravel's validation features, including Form Requests, for data integrity
  - Implement database indexing and use Laravel's query optimization features for better performance
  - Use Laravel Telescope for debugging and performance monitoring in development
  - Leverage Laravel Nova or Filament for rapid admin panel development
  - Implement proper security measures, including CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and input sanitization

Code Architecture:
  - Naming Conventions:
    - Use consistent naming conventions for folders, classes, and files.
    - Follow Laravel's conventions: singular for models, plural for controllers (e.g., User.php, UsersController.php).
    - Use PascalCase for class names, camelCase for method names, and snake_case for database columns.
  - Controller Design:
    - Controllers should be final classes to prevent inheritance.
    - Make controllers read-only (i.e., no property mutations).
    - Avoid injecting dependencies directly into controllers. Instead, use method injection or service classes.
  - Model Design:
    - Models should be final classes to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior from inheritance.
  - Services:
    - Create a Services folder within the app directory.
    - Organize services into model-specific services and other required services.
    - Service classes should be final and read-only.
    - Use services for complex business logic, keeping controllers thin.
  - Routing:
    - Maintain consistent and organized routes.
    - Create separate route files for each major model or feature area.
    - Group related routes together (e.g., all user-related routes in routes/user.php).
  - Type Declarations:
    - Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
    - Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.
    - Leverage PHP 8.3+ features like union types and nullable types when necessary.
  - Data Type Consistency:
    - Be consistent and explicit with data type declarations throughout the codebase.
    - Use type hints for properties, method parameters, and return types.
    - Leverage PHP's strict typing to catch type-related errors early.
  - Error Handling:
    - Use Laravel's exception handling and logging features to handle exceptions.
    - Create custom exceptions when necessary.
    - Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
    - Handle exceptions gracefully and return appropriate responses.

Key points:
  - Follow Laravel’s MVC architecture for clear separation of business logic, data, and presentation layers.
  - Implement request validation using Form Requests to ensure secure and validated data inputs.
  - Use Laravel’s built-in authentication system, including Laravel Sanctum for API token management.
  - Ensure the REST API follows Laravel standards, using API Resources for structured and consistent responses.
  - Leverage task scheduling and event listeners to automate recurring tasks and decouple logic.
  - Implement database transactions using Laravel's database facade to ensure data consistency.
  - Use Eloquent ORM for database interactions, enforcing relationships and optimizing queries.
  - Implement API versioning for maintainability and backward compatibility.
  - Optimize performance with caching mechanisms like Redis and Memcached.
  - Ensure robust error handling and logging using Laravel’s exception handler and logging features.
  
# .cursorrules
Follow Laravel MVC separation principles: controllers for logic, models for database, views for presentation.
Use PSR-12 formatting and Laravel naming conventions throughout (proper indentation, class/variable names).
Validate and sanitize all user inputs, especially OTP fields and any role-based actions. Use form requests and middleware.
For every AJAX POST request, use Axios and include the CSRF token (e.g. from <meta name="csrf-token">).
Use SweetAlert2 for all user popups (confirmations, error messages, notifications).
Do not modify existing Blade layouts or CSS unless absolutely necessary; reuse components and partials.
Write clear, DRY code: break large methods into smaller functions, avoid repeating JS/PHP logic, and comment complex sections.
