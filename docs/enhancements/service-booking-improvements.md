# Service Booking System Enhancements

This document outlines proposed improvements to the Service Booking system based on current implementation analysis and user feedback.

## Error Handling & Reliability Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Logging**
   - Add detailed context to error logs including user ID, order details, and all relevant payload data
   - Implement structured logging with distinguishable error categories
   - Consider using a monitoring service like Sentry for real-time error tracking

2. **Transaction Isolation**
   - Increase database transaction isolation level for order processing to prevent race conditions
   - Implement optimistic locking on wallet balance updates to prevent concurrent modification issues

3. **Retry Mechanisms**
   - Add automatic retry logic for Stripe payment processing with exponential backoff
   - Implement idempotency keys for payment processing to prevent duplicate charges

4. **Validation Refinements**
   - Add server-side validation for service availability before accepting bookings
   - Implement rate limiting on order submission to prevent accidental duplicate submissions

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Order Confirmation Enhancements**
   - Provide detailed order summary on success page
   - Add ability to download/print order receipt
   - Show estimated service time based on current queue

2. **Payment Flow Improvements**
   - Add "low balance" warning before attempting wallet payment
   - Add option to top up wallet directly from order page if balance is insufficient
   - Improve saved card management with card icons and better UX

3. **Status Tracking**
   - Implement real-time order status updates
   - Send SMS notifications for status changes
   - Add order tracking page with detailed timeline

## Technical Improvements

1. **Code Refactoring**
   - Extract payment processing logic to dedicated service classes
   - Implement service layer pattern to separate business logic from controllers
   - Create dedicated DTOs for service booking data

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
   - Implement caching for service information and pricing data
   - Consider queue-based processing for time-intensive operations

3. **Testing Improvements**
   - Add integration tests for the entire booking flow
   - Implement snapshot testing for UI components
   - Add load testing to verify system stability under high load

## Mobile Integration

1. **API Enhancements**
   - Expand API endpoints to support all booking operations
   - Implement proper API versioning
   - Add comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

2. **Mobile-Specific Features**
   - Add location services integration for easier pickup location selection
   - Implement push notifications for booking status updates
   - Add QR code generation for service verification at stations
