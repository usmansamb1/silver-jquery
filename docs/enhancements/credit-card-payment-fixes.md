# Credit Card Payment System Fixes & Enhancements

## Issue Summary
Credit card payments were processing successfully but were not being recorded in:
1. Wallet history (`/wallet/history`)
2. Activity logs (`/my-activity`)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Hyperpay Payment Processing Issues
- **Problem**: `hyperpayStatus()` method was using `$wallet->deposit()` without creating Payment records
- **Impact**: No payment history, missing activity logs
- **Location**: `WalletController::hyperpayStatus()`

### 2. Payment Process Method Issues
- **Problem**: Relied on `session('topup_amount')` without proper fallback
- **Impact**: Invalid amounts or missing data
- **Location**: `WalletController::paymentProcess()`

### 3. Missing Database Transactions
- **Problem**: No transaction rollback on failures
- **Impact**: Potential data inconsistency
- **Location**: Multiple payment methods

### 4. Incomplete Activity Logging
- **Problem**: LogHelper calls were incomplete or missing
- **Impact**: User activity not tracked properly
- **Location**: Various payment processing methods

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Payment Processing (`WalletController::paymentProcess()`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added proper amount validation from request and session
- Implemented database transactions with rollback
- Created comprehensive Payment records with notes
- Used `$wallet->deposit()` for proper transaction recording
- Enhanced activity logging with detailed metadata
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Support for both JSON and redirect responses

**Code Enhancement:**
```php
// Before
$amount = session('topup_amount', 0);
$wallet->balance += $amount;
$wallet->save();

// After
$amount = $request->input('amount') ?? session('topup_amount', 0);
DB::beginTransaction();
$transaction = $wallet->deposit($amount, 'description', $payment, $metadata);
LogHelper::logWalletRecharge($wallet, $description, $metadata);
DB::commit();
```

### 2. Improved Hyperpay Processing (`WalletController::hyperpayStatus()`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added Payment record creation for each successful transaction
- Implemented proper wallet transaction recording
- Enhanced error handling with try-catch blocks
- Added comprehensive activity logging
- Session management for amount tracking
- Detailed logging for debugging

**Benefits:**
- Payment records now appear in wallet history
- Activity logs properly created
- Better error tracking and debugging
- Session cleanup after successful payments

### 3. Enhanced JavaScript Integration

**Changes Made:**
- Added payment gateway identification in requests
- Improved amount passing between frontend and backend
- Better session storage management for Hyperpay
- Enhanced error handling in frontend

## Database Schema Verification

### Payment Records
- ✅ `user_id`: Properly linked to users
- ✅ `payment_type`: Set to 'credit_card'
- ✅ `amount`: Accurate amount recording
- ✅ `status`: 'approved' for successful payments
- ✅ `notes`: Descriptive payment information

### Wallet Transactions
- ✅ `wallet_id`: Linked to user's wallet
- ✅ `user_id`: Linked to payment user
- ✅ `amount`: Matches payment amount
- ✅ `type`: Set to 'deposit'
- ✅ `status`: 'completed' for successful transactions
- ✅ `reference_type`/`reference_id`: Linked to Payment model
- ✅ `metadata`: Contains payment gateway info

### Activity Logs
- ✅ `causer_id`: User who made the payment
- ✅ `event`: 'wallet_recharge'
- ✅ `description`: Descriptive message
- ✅ `properties`: Payment metadata
- ✅ `subject_type`/`subject_id`: Linked to Wallet model

## Testing Implementation

### Created Test Command
```bash
php artisan test:credit-card-payments --user-id=1 --amount=100
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Stripe payment processing
- Hyperpay payment processing
- Payment record creation
- Wallet transaction recording
- Activity log creation
- Balance verification
- Database consistency checks

## User Interface Improvements

### Wallet History Page (`/wallet/history`)
- ✅ Displays credit card payments with proper icons
- ✅ Shows payment amounts and timestamps
- ✅ Status badges for payment states
- ✅ Separate section for wallet transactions
- ✅ Pagination support

### Activity Logs Page (`/my-activity`)
- ✅ Shows wallet recharge activities
- ✅ Filterable by event type and date
- ✅ Detailed activity descriptions
- ✅ Proper metadata display
